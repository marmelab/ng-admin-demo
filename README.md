# ng-admin demo configuration

This is a demo of the [ng-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin) module for Angular.js. It creates a working administration for a list of posts, comments, and tags. You can test it online at [http://ng-admin.marmelab.com/](http://ng-admin.marmelab.com/).

The interesting part of the code is in [public/app.js](https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin-demo/blob/master/public/app.js)

## Installation

make install
```

## Run
